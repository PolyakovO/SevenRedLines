## Task Description

The objective of this project is to fulfill a humorous, paradoxical technical requirement:

Draw 7 red lines.
All lines must be perfectly perpendicular to each other.
Some of the lines should be green, while others should be transparent.
One line should be shaped like a kitten.
This project uses TDD to approach and validate these conflicting requirements, demonstrating how testing can expose contradictions and clarify constraints in impossible scenarios.
